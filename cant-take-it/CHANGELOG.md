# Changelog

All notable changes to *You Can't Take It With You* are listed here.

Unpublished work stays under **[Unreleased]** until David says to publish.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Annual surplus (salary / SS net of expenses & taxes) now goes to **The Bank** (`cash`) instead of savings
- Player-facing copy: “cash on hand” / Cash → **The Bank** (HUD still shortens to Bank where space is tight)

### Added
- Hallway of Time **glass wall**: deterministic projection finds the first year The Bank would be ≤ $0; translucent cyan barrier blocks walking past that door, with a message to enter an earlier year and rebuild The Bank

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- Smartphone virtual pad (D-pad + A / B / Menu); auto-shows on coarse pointer, touch, or width ≤900px
- Hint text for phone controls

### Changed
- Responsive canvas fit: scale to available viewport (topbar, hint, `visualViewport`), with fractional scale and integer snap when waste is small
- Layout CSS for phone browsers (`100dvh`, frame max-width, smaller chrome, `touch-action: none`, `viewport-fit=cover`)
- Cache-bust query bumped to `?v=0.4.0`

### Notes
- Sizing-only commit `ab91795` can be reverted alone with `git revert ab91795` while keeping touch controls

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- Named large purchases: purchase name flows into Hallway portals (“Purchased {name}”, “Paid off: {name}”)

### Changed
- Brighter, more visible life-event aura portals (bloom, cyan/violet band, wall streaks, clearer text plate)

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- On-canvas build version label (bottom-right) for cache confirmation
- Asset / module cache-bust `?v=` tied to `GAME_VERSION`

---

## [0.2.x] — 2026-09-27 (pre-version-label batch)

Shipped before the visible version badge; grouped for history.

### Added
- Financed large purchases (down payment, interest rate, term) with amortizing `otherLoans`
- Hallway life-event auras + bottom banners (mortgage/loan payoff, retirement, “{child} goes to college”, named purchases)
- National average college tuition as annual expense at college age
- Decision Room tellers evenly on east / south / west; north wall is Hallway doorway only
- Icon-only wall signs (full names still on `[E]` prompt)
- Hallway: red lanterns on timeline wall; blue-flame torches every five years on the door side
- Floating HUD strip above the playfield (Age + kids, Year, Bank, Portfolio, Salary)

### Fixed
- Sticky movement keys after typing in dialogs (e.g. kid name containing “d”)

### Changed
- Setup UX: Back on steps, comma-formatted money, rates as %, household gross salary wording, kid names (no tickers), difficulty descriptions with Standard default
- Hallway doors start at leave year + 1; narrower void; walk animation polish

---
