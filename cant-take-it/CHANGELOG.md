## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Setup: traditional **401(k)** — starting balance, employee contribution (% of salary, annual cap `K401_EMPLOYEE_LIMIT` = $23,500 TY 2025), employer match (match % of deferrals on first X% of salary)
- Engine: while employed, 401(k) deferral from paycheck + employer match; balance grows with difficulty equity return; included in Portfolio / net worth (illiquid for Decision Room spending)
- Retirement: when `retired`, auto **401(k) withdrawal → Cash** to cover year shortfalls (taxable ordinary income via Tax.js); ledger: `401(k) withdrawal → Cash: $X (tax $Y)`
- Decision Room **Borrow** window (6th teller, east wall with Job — layout W2/S2/E2):
  - **HELOC** — CLTV 80% of home value minus mortgage and existing HELOCs; amortizing; proceeds → Cash; lien paid off on home sale
  - **Loan against shares** — 50% LTV on taxable brokerage only (not 401(k)); amortizing; margin call sells stock if over LTV
  - APRs shown clearly in prompts and confirm (defaults: HELOC 8.5%, securities 7.0%; player adjustable within mid-2020s bands)
- Hallway of Time **glass wall**: deterministic projection finds the first year Cash would be ≤ $0; translucent cyan barrier blocks walking past that door, with a message to enter an earlier year and rebuild Cash

### Changed
- Player-facing rename: **The Bank / Bank → Cash** (HUD, setup, dialogs, surplus events, glass wall, charts, ending). Internal field remains `cash`
- Annual surplus → **Cash** (`cash`) instead of savings
- Borrow / other loans: full amortizing P&I is an annual cash-flow expense (interest called out in year events for HELOC and share-backed loans)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- Smartphone virtual pad (D-pad + A / B / Menu); auto-shows on coarse pointer, touch, or width ≤900px
- Hint text for phone controls

### Changed
- Responsive canvas fit: scale to available viewport (topbar, hint, `visualViewport`), with fractional scale and integer snap when waste is small
- Layout CSS for phone browsers (`100dvh`, frame max-width, smaller chrome, `touch-action: none`, `viewport-fit=cover`)
- Cache-bust query bumped to `?v=0.4.0`

### Notes
- Sizing-only commit `ab91795` can be reverted alone with `git revert ab91795` while keeping touch controls

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-27

### Added
- Named large purchases: purchase name flows into Hallway portals (“Purchased {name}”, “Paid off: {name}”)

### Changed
- Brighter, more visible life-event aura portals (bloom, cyan/violet band, wall streaks, clearer text plate)

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added

## [0.2.x] — 2026-09-27 (pre-version-label batch)

Shipped before the visible version badge; grouped for history.

### Added
- Financed large purchases (down payment, interest rate, term) with amortizing `otherLoans`
- Hallway life-event auras + bottom banners (mortgage/loan payoff, retirement, “{child} goes to college”, named purchases)
- National average college tuition as annual expense at college age
- Decision Room tellers evenly on east / south / west; north wall is Hallway doorway only
- Icon-only wall signs (full names still on `[E]` prompt)
- Hallway: red lanterns on timeline wall; blue-flame torches every five years on the door side
- Floating HUD strip above the playfield (Age + kids, Year, Bank, Portfolio, Salary)

### Fixed
- Sticky movement keys after typing in dialogs (e.g. kid name containing “d”)

### Changed
- Setup UX: Back on steps, comma-formatted money, rates as %, household gross salary wording, kid names (no tickers), difficulty descriptions with Standard default
- Hallway doors start at leave year + 1; narrower void; walk animation polish
